# SM-NT-Empty-Map-Changer
Sourcemod plugin that changes to the nextmap when server is empty.
Plugin will check if the player count is 1 or less (includes bots and stv), every 39 minutes and change map if it is.  
Set `mp_timelimit 0`  

It will also re-start the first map after server starts to enable STV to load in etc.
