# SM-NT-Empty-Map-Restart
Sourcemod plugin for Neotokyo that changes to the nextmap when server is empty and will attempt to restart after approx 7 hours if empty.
Plugin will check if the player count is 1 or less (includes bots and stv), every 39 minutes and change map if it is, and then restart after 9 checks, about 7 hours.
